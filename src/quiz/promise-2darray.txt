The code initializes a function sum2DArray() to asynchronously calculate the sum of elements in a 2D array. Upon calling this function with a valid 2D array, it logs messages indicating the start of the sum calculation, resolves the promise with the computed sum after a brief delay, and then returns from the function. However, if the input is not an array, the function rejects the promise with an error message indicating the expected input type.

Subsequently, two promises are created with different inputs: a valid 2D array (array2D) and a string ('array2D'). These promises are handled using .then() and .catch() methods to capture the resolved value or rejection reason, respectively. Asynchronous execution allows the code to continue running while waiting for the promises to be resolved or rejected. Consequently, the logging messages indicating promise creation, resolution, rejection, and handling are interspersed based on the order of asynchronous execution and any synchronous code present in the script.
